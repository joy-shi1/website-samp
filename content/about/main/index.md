  My current research focuses on applying causal inference methods in 
  administrative health databases and other observational data to conduct target 
  trial emulations which inform clinical and policy decision-making. This work 
  has largely focused on evaluating screening strategies for colorectal cancer 
  and prostate cancer using data from the Nordic-European Initiative on 
  Colorectal Cancer (NordICC) trial and electronic health record data from the 
  Veterans Health Administration, respectively. 
  
  Methodologically, my work focuses on addressing some of the limitations of 
  instrumental variable methods, a statistical technique that can be used to 
  estimate causal effects, even in the presence of unmeasured confounding. 
  This includes (1) developing instrumental variable methods for time-varying 
  treatments and outcomes (via g-estimation of structural models), and the 
  application of these methods to Mendelian randomization (MR) studies; (2) 
  evaluating and quantifying the impact of different study designs for Mendelian 
  randomization; and (3) mitigating common sources of selection bias in 
  Mendelian randomization studies. 
  
  Previous research (during my MSc in Epidemiology at [Queen's University](https://phs.queensu.ca/graduate-programs/msc-epidemiology) and as a Data Analyst 
  at the [Center for Global Child Health](https://www.sickkids.ca/en/care-services/centres/global-child-health/) 
  at the Hospital for Sick Children) includes work in cancer epidemiology, 
  genetics, and global child health and nutrition.</span><br><br>

  I teach methods for causal inference at the **Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public
  Health** (as part of the Department of Epidemiology and 
  [CAUSALab](https://causalab.sph.harvard.edu/courses/)), and **Harvard Medical School** 
  (as part of their [Master of Medical Sciences in Clinical Investigation (MMSCI)](https://postgraduateeducation.hms.harvard.edu/masters-programs/master-medical-sciences-clinical-investigation) program).
