      I teach epidemiologic and causal inference methods. 
      
      A full description of my teaching experiences is available 
      [**here**](/teaching/99-teaching-experiences/), 
      some of which are highlighted below:

        *Causal inference for time-fixed exposures; key concepts include bias, methods for confounding adjustment, instrumental variable estimation, and target trial emulation.*<br><br>

      - [**Lead Pedagogy Fellow**](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/office-of-education/pedagogy-fellows/), Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health<br>
        *(2020-2021)*<br><br>
