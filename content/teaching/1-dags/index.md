  An introduction to the basic components of a directed acyclic graph (DAGs), 
  how to identify structural sources of bias (i.e., confounding, selection bias, 
  information bias) using a DAG, and extensions to time-varying treatments.

**Learning objectives**
1. Identify features of a DAG.
2. Understand the rules of d-separation.
3. Use a causal DAG to identify bias due to confounding and selection bias.
4. Identify control strategies to account for bias due to confounding and selection bias.

**Learning objectives**
1. Identify different types of information bias on a DAG
2. Recognize the structure of treatment-confounder feedback on a DAG.
3. Identify situations when stratification-based methods fail.
4. Devise an approach to draw your own causal DAGs.
