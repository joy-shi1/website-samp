  We assess the extent to which the effect of maternal micronutrient 
  supplementation (MMS) in pregnancy on infant mortality is mediated by birth 
  weight, gestation age and weight-for-gestational age.

**Background**: Maternal micronutrient supplementation in pregnancy (MMS) has been shown to improve birth weight among infants in low- and middle-income countries. Recent evidence suggests that the survival benefits of MMS are greater for female infants compared to male infants, but the mechanisms leading to differential effects remain unclear.

**Objective**: The objective of this study was to examine the potential mechanisms through which MMS acts on infant mortality among Tanzanian infants.

**Methods**: We used data collected from pregnant women and newborns in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of MMS conducted in Tanzania to examine mediators of the effect of MMS on 6-wk infant mortality ([NCT00197548](http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00197548)). Causal mediation analyses with the counterfactual approach were conducted to assess the contributions of MMS on survival via their effects on birth weight, gestational age, weight-for-gestational age, and the joint effect of gestational age and weight-for-gestational age. The weighting method allowed for interaction between gestational age and weight-for-gestational age.

**Results**: Among 7486 newborns, the effect of MMS on 6-wk survival was fully mediated (100%) through the joint effect of gestational age and weight-for-gestational age. MMS was also found to have a significant natural indirect effect through increased birth weight (P-value < 0.001) that explained 75% of the total effect on 6-wk mortality. When analyses were stratified by sex, changes in gestational age and weight-for-gestational age fully mediated the mortality effect among female infants (n = 3570), but these mediators only explained 34% of the effect among males (n = 3833).

**Conclusions**: The potential sex-specific effects of MMS on mortality may be a result of differences in mechanisms related to birth outcomes. In the context of the Tanzanian trial, the observed effect of MMS on 6-wk mortality for female infants was entirely mediated by increased gestation duration and improved intrauterine growth, while these mechanisms did not appear to be major contributors among male infants.
