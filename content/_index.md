description: I am an Epidemiologist and Assistant Professor at the Mongan 
  Institute (Massachusetts General Hospital) and CAUSALab (Harvard T.H. Chan School
  of Public Health). I am interested in target trial emulation, causal inference 
  methods (particularly instrumental variables), and pedagogy. My research 
  focuses on applications of target trial emulation and improving causal
  inference methods to answer clinically relevant questions
  about the treatment and prevention of chronic diseases.
